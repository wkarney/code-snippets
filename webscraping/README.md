## Companion code for web scraping demo
[Check out my full blog post for more details](https://medium.com/@willkarnasiewicz/getdata-pt1-webscraping-e21682e57c3f)

There a few options for running this script:
* Via Jupyter Notebook: Open [owgr-scraping.ipynb](https://github.com/wkarney/code-snippets/blob/master/webscraping/owgr-scraping.ipynb)
* As Python 3.x script from command line: 
    `python OWGR-scrape.py`

Dockerized script will be made available in future update.
