## Minted.com Address Book Export
My fianc√©e and I are approaching 100 days until our wedding and I was trying to export the addresses that we had previously saved to [minted.com](https://minted.com) from our Save the Dates, but was dismayed to learn that there was no export feature! So I built a Python script to effectively export the saved address book.

Notes for use:
* Required packages shown in requirements.txt file
* Edit lines 17 and 19 of [address-export.py](https://github.com/wkarney/code-snippets/tree/master/minted-address-scrape/address-export.py) with your [minted.com](https://minted.com) email and password
* Run as Python 3.x script from command line: 
    `python address-export.py`

I hope to add a dockerized script will be made available in future update.
